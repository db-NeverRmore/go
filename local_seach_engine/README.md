---
- **This script allows you to find the words you need in text. This script was implemented through a cheesy, crooked solution via an equally crappy buffer. But overall, it looks beautiful.**

- **Author as always is a ruthless and evil linuxoid who didn't think to install windows on qemu and test the program there**
